# Sprint Planning

- Scrum Guide: <https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html> is considered the official guide for scrum framework among the agile world.
- Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint. 
- Purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved.
- Sprint planning is done in collaboration with whole scrum team.
- Scrum encourages you to be always sprinting so you can deliver working software, while continuously learning and improving.
- You need to decide on 
  - how long the time box is going to be, 
  - the sprint goal, and 
  - where you're going to start. 
- Bad sprint plans can derail the team by setting unrealistic expectations.

## The What
- The Product owner describes the objective(or goal) of the sprint and what backlog items contribute to that goal.
- The scrum team decides what can be done in the upcoming sprint and what they will do during the sprint to make that happen.

## The How
- The development team plans the work necessary to deliver the sprint goal. Ultimately, the resulting sprint plan is a negotiation between the development team and product owner based on value and effort.

## The Who
- You cannot do sprint planning without the product owner or the development team. 
- The product owner defines the goal bsed on the value that they seek. 
- The development team needs to understand how they can or cannot deliver that goal. 
- If either is missing from this event it makes planning the sprint almost impossible.

## The Inputs
- A great starting point for the sprint plan is the product backlog as it provides a list of 'stuff' that could potentially be part of the current sprint.
- The team should also look at the existing work done in the increment and have a view to capacity.

## The Outputs
- The most important outcome for the sprint planning meeting is that the team can describe the goal of the sprint and how it will start working toward the goal.
- This is made visible in the sprint backlog.

# Prep for sprint planning
- The product owner must be prepared, combining the lessons from previous sprint review, stakeholder feedback, and vision for the product, so they set the scene for the sprint
- For transparancy, the product backlog should be up-to-date and refined to provide clarity
- Backlog refinement is and optional event in scrum, because some backlogs don't need it. However, for most teams, it's better to get the team togeather to review and refine the backlog prior to sprint planning.

> Pro Tip: If you have a two-week sprint, run a backlog refinement meeting in the middle of the sprint. It's great for the team to step back from the sprint and look at what's next. Not only does it help prepare for sprint planning, but also can give a different prespective for the current work

# Setting a time limit for sprint planning
- Sprint planning should be constrained no more than two hours for each week of the sprint.
- Sprint planning for a two-week sprint would be no longer than two hours. This is called "timeboxing", setting a maximum amount of time for the team to accomplish a task, in this case, planning the sprint.
- If team is happy before the timebox is finished, then the event is over.
- There is no minimum time allowed.

> Pro Tip: Focus the first part of sprint planning on the objective of the sprint rather than the details of the backlog. By focussing on the goal rather than the work it is possible to find smart alternatives for how that goal is achieved.

# Focus on the outcomes, no the work
- During sprint planning it is easy to get 'bogged down' in the work focusing on which task should come first, who should do it, and how long it will take.
- For complex work, the level of information you know at the start can be low, and much of it is based on assumptions. 
- Scrum is an emperical process, meaning that you can't plan upfront, but rather learn by doing, and then feed that information back into the process.

- The sprint goal describes the objective of the sprint at a high level, but the backlog Items can also be written with an outcome in mind. 
- User stories are one great way of describing the work from a customer point of view.
- User stories written like `As < type of user >, I want < a goal > so that < a reason >`, re-focus defects, issues, and improvements on the outcome the customer is seeking rather than the observed problem.
- By adding clear, measureable results to the user story, the outcomes can be clearly measured, and you know when you are done.
- By getting as much up-front clarity as possible on the work the team is focusing on, everyone gets the trasparency needed to get started on the work. 

> Pro Tip: Not knowing someting is differnt from being vague. Don't ignore the unknowns, they are the reality of doing difficult work. But don't hide them by using vague words. Instead, be clear when you don't know something and frame the work in terms of gaining an understanding.

# Estimates

- Sprint planning requires some level of estimation. The team needs to define what can or cannot be done in the sprint: estimated effor vs capacity.
- Estimation is ofen confused with commitments.
- Estimates are by their very nature forecasts based on the knowledge at hand.
- The more unknowns, the less likely the estimation will be correct.

# Sprint planning best practices
- The focus of sprint planning is to build a 'just enough' plan for the next sprint.
- A good sprint plan motivates everyone by defining an outcome and a clear plan for success.
- while building Sprint plans, focus on the goal and build enough of a sprint backlog to get started.
- Next, ensure that the product backlog is ordered to allow the team to pickup work if they delivered on the sprint goal early.
- Scrum is a process framework aimed at solving complex problems. Complex problems require emprical process (learning by doing). Emperical process are very hard to plan, so don't kid yourself--you can't build the perfect plan. Istead, focus on the outcomes and get going. It doesnot have to be hard, even though the problem you are solving is.
